# Source code for failed "TF2 degrees of separation" project


# How this works:
- Data download: launch a DOS on logs.tf with dl.sh
- Logs will be named nicely because logs.tf is awesome
- Fill in the correct number range in extract_players.py
- Results put in stuff.json
- stuff.json is used in the single page React app (which really just puts stuff to console for now)
- And App.js is self explanatory ... kinda
